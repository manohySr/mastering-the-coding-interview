/**
 * Linked Lists
 * keywords:
 *      head - tail - null
 * It is a linked lists (lol)
 * TS/JS doesn't have linkedlist DS prebuild in (Java has a linkedlist prebuild)
 * the list contains node:
 *      a node has a data and a pointer
 *          data is the actual data
 *          pointer point to the next data
 *          exemple:
 *              apple -> banana -> ananas -> null
 *              but more like
 *              apple
 *              10058 -> banana
 *                       89603 -> ananas
 *                                45213 -> null
 *          we can take a conclusion that the last data pointed is null
 *
 * The first node is called head
 * The last node is called tail
